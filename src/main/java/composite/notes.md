# Composite Design Pattern

The Adapter design pattern is a structural design pattern. It allows incompatible interfaces to work with each other by turning one interface into an object so that those aiming to collaborate can understand the interface. An adapter is also referred to as a wrapper because it envelops the object, hiding the complexity of conversions happening between interfaces and objects. This way, the wrapped object remains unaware of the adapter.
